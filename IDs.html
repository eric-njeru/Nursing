Assessment
  <div class="column">
  <p>A. Follow general assessment modalities for postoperative clients.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <p>B. Observe neurological signs.
      Evaluate level of consciousness.
      a. Orientation to time and place.
      b. Response to painful stimuli: Pinch Achilles tendon or test with safety pin.</p>
    <p>c. Ability to follow verbal command.
      Evaluate pupil size and reactions to light.
      a. Are pupils equal, not constricted or dilated?
      b. Do pupils react to light?
      c. Do pupils react sluggishly or are they fixed?
      Evaluate strength and motion of extremities.
      a. Are hand grasps present and equal?
      b. Are hand grasps strong or weak?
      c. Can client move all extremities on command?
      d. Are movements purposeful or involuntary?
      e. Do the extremities have twitching, flaccid, or spastic movements (indicative of a neurological problem)?</p>
  <div class="column">
      <p>C. Observe vital signs.
      Keep client normothermic to decrease metabolic needs of the brain.
      Observe respirations for depth and rate to prevent respiratory acidosis from anoxia.
      Observe blood pressure and pulse for signs of shock or increased intracranial pressure.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <p>D . Evaluate reflexes.
      Babinski—positive Babinski is elicited by stroking the lateral aspect of the sole of the foot, backward flexion of the great toe, or spreading of other toes.
      a. Most important pathological reflex in neurology.
      b. If positive, indicative of pyramidal tract involvement (usually upper motor neuron lesion).
      Romberg—when client stands with feet close together, he or she falls off balance. If positive, may have cerebellar, proprioceptive, or vestibular difficulties.
      Kernig—client is lying down with thigh flexed at a right angle; extension of the leg upward results in spasm of hamstring muscle, pain, and resistance to additional extension of leg at the knee (indicative of meningitis).</p>

  <div class="column">
    <p>E. Observe for headache, double vision, nausea, or vomiting.</p>
